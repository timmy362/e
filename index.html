    <p>The Treaty of Waitangi, signed on 6 February 1840, is New Zealand’s founding document. It was an agreement in Māori and English between the British Crown and approximately 540 Māori chiefs. The Treaty was a response to issues arising from increasing British presence and land transactions with Māori, as well as French interests in New Zealand. It aimed to protect Māori interests, regulate British subjects, and secure commercial interests by establishing British sovereignty.<br>

The Treaty consists of three articles:<br>

In the English version, Māori cede sovereignty of New Zealand to Britain.
Māori give the Crown exclusive rights to buy lands they wish to sell and are guaranteed full ownership rights of their lands, forests, fisheries, and other possessions.
Māori are granted the rights and privileges of British subjects.<br>
However, the Māori version has significant differences, notably the translation of ‘sovereignty’ as ‘kawanatanga’ (governance), which has led to ongoing discussions about the Treaty’s interpretation and implementation</p>
